# ⚡ Hello, World... or should I say, Hello, Data.

I’m an **Aspiring Data Analyst** who believes every dataset hides a story —  
sometimes it whispers, sometimes it screams. My job? Decode it.  

⚡ Powered by **SQL, Python, and caffeine**.  
💡 Obsessed with **AI and technology**, because the future isn’t waiting — it’s already here.  
🎯 Goal: turn raw data into insights sharper than Stark tech and darker than an fsociety hack.
